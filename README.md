# CMPG-323-Project-4---31607500
project 4 of CMPG 323
In this project we made use of UiPath to automate the entry of data into a website.
We used various skills taught to us throughout the sprint to complete this project.
This project is linked to the kanban board project to keep track of time and the project itself.

# Content

This is one of the projects I enjoyed doing the most and studying UiPath also got me more and more interested in its uses. I used tutorials found online as well as classes to further my knowladge on UiPath and this allowed me to do the project well.
All functions were added to the best of my knowladge and allowed the program to read data form an excel sheet, write it into a website as well as delete the data. All this was also checked and the excel sheet was updated to reflect the success of the functions, changing the values to true if the function worked and false if an error occured.

# Problems

Any issues with the project were easily solved by looking up on the forums or searching for answers elsewhere.

# Future

I enjoyed using UiPath and I am doing more courses to gain a deeper knowladge on its uses and functions thus I plan to make use of it in future projects where I am able to.
